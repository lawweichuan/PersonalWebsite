          <p> I independently developed this application using C++ with QT libraries since 2016 to enhance my C++
            skills in efficiently crawling and handling large amounts of data. I have a passion for applying
            quantitative models and technology to solve real-world problems, and find satisfaction in refining my
            analytical skills. This application underwent consistent
            improvement over five years, both after work and during weekends.
            This application is to provide comprehensive functionality,
            including chart plotting and exploration of viable approaches to forecast stock trends,
            such as analyzing volume of trade, point and figure charts, indices, etc. It also features
            fully automated web crawling for large-scale time series data from SGX, Google, Yahoo, etc.
            Additionally, the application supports backtesting among 38 technical indicators with
            identified parameters for maximal returns. Check out the video demonstration by clicking my OneDrive link

          <p> In order to improve my programming skills in Python, since I have all the data obtained from the
            abovementioned Stock Screening Application, an attempt was made to utilize state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow,
            Keras, and Scikit-learn, for training and forecasting stock prices using Regression, Classification, and
            LSTM approaches. Stock prices were imported, and data cleaning and visualization were performed using
            libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.
            This topic was chosen because the predictability of stock prices is really a complex and debated topic.
            Stock prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including economic indicators, company performance,
            geopolitical events,
            market sentiment, and more. While there are efforts to analyze historical data and use various models
            to predict future stock movements, it's important to note that the stock market is inherently unpredictable
            due to its dynamic and often irrational nature. The challenge of predicting stock prices is a
            fascinating aspect of financial markets. Please click on the

          <img src="images/sw-ULExoGUI_2.png" alt="" width="100%">
          <p> I was tasked with designing the entire software architecture, integrating software components with the Boost library and
            multithreading, and developing a comprehensive user interface using C++ and Python on Ubuntu with ROS (Robot Operating System) within a
            six-month timeframe. The objective of this effort was to realize real-time data visualization for
            IMUs, encoders, and force sensors, allowing users to monitor the condition of the exoskeleton. This system
            enables users to input customized parameters where the data will be saved for personalization, and
            manipulate the upper limb exoskeleton. You can view a demonstration of the system by clicking on the OneDrive link provided

          <img src="images/sw-MRCA.png" alt="" width="100%">
          <p> I independently developed a web-based user interface within 3 months for teleoperating an electric
            wheelchair. The interface, created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on Ubuntu with ROS, displays real-time camera
            images and a 2D map of the environment. A registration and login authentication system was created in MongoDB using
            Mongoose to allow user access the website. State-of-the-art libraries such as rosbridge and roslibjs were
            employed in the implementation. For a video demonstration, please click on the OneDrive link provided
